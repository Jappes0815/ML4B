# Identify Topics in Scientific Digital Twin Literature


## Read me when analysing the models

The results link to the visualized Topic models. There you can explore and interpret the topic model. For the use of the interactive visualization tool please note:
- The circles on the left are topics and can be clicked to identify the frequency of the words they contain. 
- On the right side, the frequency of a word in a topic is shown with a red bar. 
- Blue bars are used to show the frequency in the entire dataset.
- Use the slide on the top right corner to adjust the ratio on red to blue.
