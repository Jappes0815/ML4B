# Identify Topics in Scientific Digital Twin Literature

In our project we identify topics within scientific digital twin literature by using LDA for topic modeling.
As we used the data with multiple topic numbers for titles, abstracts and texts seperately, we ended up with a variation of topic models we want to share with you:

[Titles with 10 Topics](https://jappes0815.github.io/ML4B/topics_title_lda10.html)

[Abstracts with 10 Topics](https://jappes0815.github.io/ML4B/topics_abstract_lda10.html)

[Texts with 10 Topics](https://jappes0815.github.io/ML4B/topics_text_lda10.html)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Jappes0815/ML4B/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Jappes0815/ML4B/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
